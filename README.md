# Sample reflection
This is a sample Twine game. It begins with the opening paragraph of Lyotard's essay "It's as if a Line ..." It then explores the themes of the essay as they are prefigured in the opening sentence as a way of interogating the relationship between building and making. It performs its arguments rather than making them explicitly (and none of its explicit statements is meant to be read too literally). It's argument does not exist in the passages but between them.
